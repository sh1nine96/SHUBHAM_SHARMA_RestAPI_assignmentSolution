<p>This is Spring Boot Rest APIs Web Application Project, where we have created APIs to do CRUD operations. We have added Spring Security feature so that we can secure our endpoints</p>
<br>

## Few features that we have here are as follows:
<ol>
    <li>We can dynamically add Roles</li>
    <li>We can dynamically add Users</li>
    <li>Only Admin can add Employees in Database</li>
    <li>We have listAllEmployee Endpoint</li>
    <li>We can find Employee by Id</li>
    <li>We can update existing employee in DB</li>
    <li>Deletion by Employee Id is possible</li>
    <li>Endpoint to fetch an employee by first name, if found more than one record then list them all-</li>
    <li>We can sort All Employees by their first name is ASC or DESC order</li>
</ol>
