<h2> Few features that we have here are as follows: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>We can dynamically add Roles</li>
    <li>We can dynamically add Users</li>
    <li>Only Admin can add Employees in Database</li>
    <li>We have listAllEmployee Endpoint</li>
    <li>We can find Employee by Id</li>
    <li>We can update existing employee in DB</li>
    <li>Deletion by Employee Id is possible</li>
    <li>Endpoint to fetch an employee by first name, if found more than one record then list them all</li>
    <li>We can sort All Employees by their first name is ASC or DESC order</li>
</ol>
